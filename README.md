# RtkDotNetLinux

RTK is a bunch of wrappers around things I use too often to mess with their default interfaces. Note that it's in no way a full fledged library, things are added in order in which I need them in my projects and those which I don't usually aren't and won't get implemented unless I need them somewhere.

The library is intended exclusively for my projects, and therefore doesn't follow any back-compatibility, functionality or consistency principles. The code is published purely for transparency reasons.

This is its .NET version for Linux.
